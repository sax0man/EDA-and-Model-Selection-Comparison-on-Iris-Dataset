# EDA-and-Model-Selection-Comparison-on-Iris-Dataset

Performed EDA on the iris dataset.
Created a DecisionTreeClassifier model and performed KFold and StratifiedKFold cross validation with 10 splits on the data and plotted a learning curve.
Used GridSearch Cross validation for finding the best hyper parameters and plotted a confusion matrix and used accuracy_score to determine the performance of the model.
